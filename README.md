# UGC Styles

A baseline set of styles for user-generated content.

### What this is

UGC Styles is a CSS file (`ugc.css`) that includes all the styles you need to ensure content on your site is styled. Styles are only applied to areas that have a parent element with the class `ugc`, so it can be limited to content-specific markup.

### And what this is *not*

This is *not* a CSS framework for styling the layout and design of your website - just blocks of content (paragraphs, lists, code snippets, and so on).

### When to use this

Any time you have stripped a browser’s default styles or haven’t specified styles for content elements, use UGC Styles. It’s great for blog posts, comments and other user-generated content because it ensures that the content will be rendered properly. (How many times have we reset CSS and forgotten to include styles for code snippets, ordered lists, etc.?)

### Why this was made

### How to use this

1. [Download](https://github.com/joshuarudd/ugc-styles/zipball/master) and add the `ugc.css` file to your page.
2. Add the `ugc` class name to the parent element that wraps the content you want styled with UGC Styles.

Example:

    <div class="ugc">
      <p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.</p>
      <p>Are you ready for the truth?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear.</li>
        <li>Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine.</li>
        <li>You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>We swallow it too fast, we choke.</li>
        <li>We get some in our lungs, we drown.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.</p>
    </div>
